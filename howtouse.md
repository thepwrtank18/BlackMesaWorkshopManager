# How to use Black Mesa Manager

Upon first launch, you will see either this screen:

![BMM Menu](https://i.imgur.com/7lrWRZW.png)

or this screen:
![BMM Error](https://i.imgur.com/n6G1BRf.png)

If you get the latter screen, do what it says and put BMM in the Black Mesa directory. If you get the former, you have a few options.

To visit the Steam Workshop, go to the top button. To create a custom folder, go to the Create Custom Folder button. To repair your custom folder, check the
"My custom folder is broken" checkbox and click on "Repair Custom Folder". Note: This may delete the things on your custom folder! To disable the custom folder, go to the bottom button. To re-enable it, go to the "Enable Custom Folder" button.
You can tell if it's on or off by checking if you can either enable or disable it.
