# Black Mesa Manager

Ever hate having to see if your mods are causing a crash or if it's just Black Mesa? This is for you!

What this does:
* Allows you to turn off workshop addons
* ~~Allows you to turn off the custom folder~~ (work in progress)

How to use it:
1. Put it in your Black Mesa install folder (steamapps/common/Black Mesa)
2. Run it
3. Profit!

Fun fact: This used to be called Black Mesa Workshop Manager, but I decided Black Mesa Manager is better, but I don't want Visual Studio to yell at me so I'm keeping BlackMesaWorkshopManager.
