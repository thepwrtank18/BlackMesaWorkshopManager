Ever hate having to see if your mods are causing a crash or if it's just Black Mesa? This is for you!

 ## What this does
* Allows you to turn off and on workshop addons (only all of them or nothing, unfortunately)
* Allows you to turn off and on the custom folder (again, only all of them or nothing)

## How to install

If you can't see the gif, you just drag and drop it into the Black Mesa install folder!

Fun fact: This used to be called Black Mesa Workshop Manager, but I decided Black Mesa Manager is better, but I don't want Visual Studio to yell at me so I'm keeping BlackMesaWorkshopManager.

## What's new

Right now, I am making the code more understandable and less spaghetti code. There won't be new features until that's done.
